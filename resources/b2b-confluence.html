        <p>Unfortunately, MCL is excluded from this preview due to structural issues created by their models.&nbsp;If you would like to access the MCL APIs for particular requests, please contact us and we can provide you with the necessary integration details.</p>
        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>Each StitchCredit B2B API endpoint has a different request/response. However, the integration steps are the same: authentication than request the product.</p>
        <p>

        --------

        <h1>Developer Tools</h1>
        <h2>Postman Collections</h2>
        <p>The Postman Environment is pre-configured to allow you to use the scripts and walk through the Postman Scripts with minimal intervention to aid in understanding the API call structure.</p>

        --------

        <h1>Integration Guide</h1>
        <h2>Steps to integrate</h2>
        <h3>Step 1: Authentication&nbsp;</h3>
        <p>Authentication returns a Bearer token that can be used for any number of subsequent requests for 15 minutes at which point the token expires, and a new token must be retrieved by sending an Authentication request again.</p>
        <p>The postman test script for this request saves this token as a collection variable that is being used as a bearer authorization header for the other postman requests.</p>
        <p>The “User Login” request ( /users/login ) returns a token that is required for authenticating all other requests (bearer authentication).&nbsp;</p>
        <p>As mentioned, this token is valid for 15 minutes. With this token, any number of requests can be executed before it expires. In order to stay authenticated a new token will need to be requested every 15 minutes by resending the “User Login” request.&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Step 2: Request Products</h3>
        <p>StitchCredit B2B API supports reports and verification through various API endpoints. Those endpoint are described below. </p>
        <p>Each API endpoint has a different request/response. However, the integration steps are the same: authentication and then request the product through the specific API endpoint.</p>
        <h2>Products</h2>
        <p>The following different report and verification products can be requested via the StitchCredit B2B API.</p>
        <h3>Identity Verification </h3>
        <p>Currently the Identity Verification options from StitchCredit B2B API are TransUnion, LexisNexis and Experian.</p>
        <h4>TransUnion id-search</h4>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>URL: <a href="https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/transunion/id-search">https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/transunion/id-search</a>
        </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>ID Search is a specialized search based on input name and Social Security number. Input address information is optional. ID Search delivers name and address for up to eight subjects. Additionally, ID Search selects the subject that best matches the input data. ID Search also returns ID Mismatch Alert, TruValidate Fraud Alerts, and Phone Append (if the subscriber is authorized for these services). ID Search can return an FFR or a print image</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <h4>Experian CrossCore2 Precise ID</h4>
        <p>This product has multiple pieces that can be used individually depending on your requirements.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
        <p>One-Time Passcode (OTP)</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Knowledge IQ (KIQ) knowledge-based authentication products where an applicant must answer a series of questions, </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>Reverse Phone Append (rpa)</p>
        </li>
        </ol>
        <h5>Initial Request</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>URL: <a href="https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/cc2/initial">https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/cc2/initial</a>
        </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>First send the “Initial" request.</p>
        <p>OTP has a higher success rate, and should be the default flow unless the phone number provided in the "Initial" request can't be verified. If the phone number cannot be verified, the "Initial" response will contain four multiple choice KIQ questions in the "kba" object.&nbsp;</p>
        <h5>KIQ Request</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>URL: <a href="https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/cc2/kiq">https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/cc2/kiq</a>
        </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The questions have 5 answer choices numbers from 1 to 5 (not 0-4 as you might expect).&nbsp;Insert the answers to the questions into the request body of the "Final - KIQ" request. There is a limited amount of time to submit KIQ answers. The available time to complete the questions varies, but it is typically less than 10 minutes. </p>
        <h5>One Time Passcode (OTP)</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>URL: <a href="https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/cc2/otp">https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/cc2/otp</a>
        </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Provide the Session ID and the One-Time-Passcode (OTP)</p>
        <p>An SMS code is sent to the consumer for them to submit.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The Initial PreciseID query results will determine the next step, be it Knowledge IQ (KIQ) or One-Time Passcode (OTP).&nbsp; If the data provided is insufficient to identify an individual and/or generate questions, you will get a final response on this “initial” query.&nbsp; If the data provided is insufficient, you will get many results that you need to "manually" select from.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <p>More information equals higher quality results.&nbsp; It is better to add date of birth and/or full or partial Social Security Number (SSN) if multiple results are being returned frequently.&nbsp; </p>
        <p>**OTP ONLY - There will be a query telling PreciseID to send/resend the SMS code.</p>
        <p>The next query will be a submission of KIQ or OTP. If the results are sufficient, the final response will be returned.&nbsp;If the KIQ results are insufficient, you may be given additional questions to submit again, as well as OTP in the case of an incorrect code.&nbsp;Typically if too many questions are incorrectly answered a “fail” is immediately returned.&nbsp; Missing all the questions is indicative of an issue.&nbsp;For user integrity and integrity of the identity process, questions and answers shouldn't be retained.</p>
        <h5>Reverse Phone Append (RPA)&nbsp;</h5>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>URL: <a href="https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/rpa">https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/experian/rpa</a>
        </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Returns a user's name and address based on a US telephone number.&nbsp; This returned information can be used to feed the input to PreciseID.</p>
        <p>This request attempts to match the provided phone number to return the associated name and address. This endpoint uses live data, so please be judicious.</p>

        <h5>Instant ID (IID)</h5>
        <p>The StitchCredit middleware has the endpoint, <a href="https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/iid/new-request">
        <u>https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/iid/new-request</u>
        </a>, for retrieving instantID reports as JSON. </p>
        <p>The InstantID results consist of the following numeric output components:&nbsp;</p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>NAS (name, address, and SSN) index,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>NAP (name, address, and phone number) index,&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>CVI (comprehensive verification index).</p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>InstantID was developed by LexisNexis to provide financial institutions with a means to compare an identity presented for account opening against all the reported identities from public record, national credit bureaus, utility sources, government sources, and institutional sources through an automated electronic interface. InstantID allows the automation of previously manually-conducted searches against electronic databases, using robust search and matching technology to replace human data entry and search term selection.</p>
        <p>

        </p>
        <h6>NAS &amp; NAP Index value</h6>
        <p>The InstantID NAS index value is a numeric value that ranges from 0 to 12 and explicitly reports which of the following input identity elements were verified with an identity that is on record at LexisNexis: first name, last name, residential address, and SSN.&nbsp;An NAS index value of 12 indicates that all four elements were verified to an identity on record.&nbsp;An NAS index value of 0 indicates that none of the four elements were verified according to an identity on record.&nbsp;NAS reporting sources contributing to LexisNexis’s records include national credit bureau header records, utility source records, and public records.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The InstantID NAP index value is also a numeric value that ranges from 0 to 12 and explicitly indicates the level of the match of the submitted name, address, and phone number. Reporting sources contributing to LexisNexis’s records include phone directory and utility records, and can also include contributed inquiry records from the LexisNexis Fraud Defense Network Event Activity data.&nbsp;Note that the NAP index provides very timely updates to name and address verification. While a phone number is also reported as a component of the NAP index, a phone number is not required to verify name and address through these sources. </p>
        <p>NAS uses name, address, and Social Security Number (SSN), while NAP uses name, address and Phone number.</p>
        <p>The NAS and NAP indices are constructed to return the highest value that can be obtained when attempting to match the input <em>name, address, </em>and<em> SSN</em> (NAS) or Phone Number (NAP) to the identities that are on record.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>For example, </p>
        <ul>
        <li>
        <p>An NAP value of 0 indicates that none of the input identity elements (first name, last name, address, or phone number) could be verified by the sources that report name, address, and phone number.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>An NAP value of 1 indicates that the phone number is associated with a different name and address. </p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>For NAS, if the first name, last name, and address are verified, and the SSN is associated with a different name and address, then the NAS index returns a value of 8. The fact that the SSN is associated with a different name and address is reported through the associated warning codes. </p>
        </li>
        </ul>
        <p>

        <h6>Comprehensive Verification Index (CVI)</h6>
        <p>There are no other embedded risk models. The NAP, NAS, and CVI results are calculated using explicitly documented, rule-based logic, and do not rely on predictive algorithms. InstantID was developed in 2002. An enhanced version of InstantID was released in 2014 that allowed policy modifications to the logic that calculated the CVI. These parameter-based modifications gave the option to increment the CVI values of 10, 20 or 30 by 10 points if the input DOB or the input driver license were matched and verified to identity data on record at LexisNexis. CVI values can only increment by 10 points if the returned value has not been capped or overridden to the value by a high risk condition.</p>
        <p>A typical financial institution will consider a CVI value of 40 or 50 to be well verified. For this broad sample, 90.9 percent of the applications received a well-verified CVI value of 40 or 50. Most financial institutions consider a CVI value of 40 or higher to be electronically verified and require no additional documentation or authentication.&nbsp;</p>

        <u>https://mware-dev.crscreditapi.com/api/mcl/request</u>
        </a>, will return data from MCL. This endpoint can be used to request Consumer Credit Reports.</p>
        <p>First, order a credit report using the “New Order” request (example provided in the Postman Collection). From the response, save the vendorOrderIdentifier, to retrieve the credit report that was ordered.&nbsp;Next, retrieve the report that is associated with this “vendorOrderIdentifier” by using the "Polling Request'' to poll the status of the order. </p>
        <p>Use a 4-7 second polling interval until the response has the "statusDescription" value,&nbsp; "READY''.&nbsp;When the "statusDescription" is "READY", then the response will also contain the borrower's credit report as JSON, HTML, and base64 encoded PDF. Reports are usually ready after ~6-10 seconds. If a report isn’t ready after 90 seconds, it’s safe to assume the order has timed out.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The <a href="https://docsend.com/view/s/rjsnmxftw59isyiv">

        <p>
        <strong>Order a report: </strong>Order a credit report, and save the vendorOrderIdentifier from its response. Use it as the vendorOrderIdentifier value in the body of the polling request.&nbsp;</p>
        </li>
        <li>
        <p>
        <strong>Poll for Report:</strong> Send MCL Polling Requests to poll the status of the order using a 4-7 second polling interval until the response has the "statusDescription" value,&nbsp; "READY''. When the "statusDescription" is "READY", then the response will contain the borrower's credit report as JSON, HTML, and base64 encoded PDF. Reports are usually ready after the first polling request, but they can take up to 90 seconds.</p>

        <p>For MCL requests, your MCL credentials are used in the background. An MCL Request can be created to specify any MCL product to which your MCL Credentials allow access. If your MCL credentials had InstantID enabled, you could retrieve InstantID through the middleware but MCL can only give you HTML and/or PDF.</p>
        <h5>Background</h5>
        <p>This endpoint can be used to interact with MCL’s SmartAPI to retrieve MCL products using JSON (for both requests and responses).&nbsp;If you would rather receive XML, then we can provide credentials that can be used to connect directly to MCL’s SmartAPI (not going through StitchCredit API) for XML responses.</p>
        <p>MCL offers various products that can be specified in the request body according to the permissions set for your credentials. Many MCL products utilize a polling workflow for retrieving data.</p>
        <p>The MCL SmartAPI documentation can be referenced for basic guidance from <a href="https://docsend.com/view/s/rjsnmxftw59isyiv">SmartAPI documentation</a>. </p>
